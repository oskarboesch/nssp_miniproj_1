The present dataset uses functional MRI and an validated emotional music
and nonmusical auditory paradigm (Lepping, et al., 2015) to examine how
neural processing of emotionally provocative auditory stimuli is altered
in depression.  Nineteen individuals with depression (MDD) and 20
never-depressed control participants (ND) listened to positive and
negative emotional musical and nonmusical stimuli during fMRI scanning. 
ND participants had no history of depression or other psychiatric
disorder, determined by administration of the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM Disorders, non-patient version (SCID-I/NP) (First,
2002).  Participants in the MDD group were all experiencing a current
depressive episode at the time of scanning, determined by screening for
research purposes using the SCID-I/NP.  Participants had no current or
past manic episodes, no comorbid anxiety disorders, and no current
alcohol abuse or dependence, and were not taking medication for
depression at the time of the study.
